                    <p>Welcome to the official website of the Air Factories 2.0 project - A distributed factory for smart, decentralized, sustainable and resilient production. Air Factories 2.0 is a project funded by the Ministry of University and Research under the FISR 2020 COVID notice from the Special Supplementary Research Fund.</p>
<p>The Air Factories 2.0 project was rated among the top ten projects eligible for funding in the PE Area - Physics and Engineering with a total budget of €69,764.90. The only partner of the project is the University of Messina.</p>

<h4 id="the-air-factories-experience">The Air Factories experience</h4>
<p>During the peak of the COVID-19 emergency, some researchers of the Department of Engineering of the University of Messina, with the support of some innovative startups, have realized an immaterial infrastructure that has allowed to easily put on the net the production capacity of 3D maker volunteers. The non-profit platform &ldquo;Air Factories&rdquo;  (<a href="http://www.airfactories.org">www.airfactories.org</a>) managed dozens of calls to-action from public structures and coordinated the action of hundreds of 3D makers throughout Italy according to the theory of the &ldquo;distributed factory&rdquo;. Even under stress, the platform has proven itself agile and responsive. In a few weeks, it allowed the realization of more than 4000 pieces. Among the more than 40 clients, there were the Niguarda Hospital in Milan, the Gemelli Hospital in Rome, the Italian Red Cross and the Civil Protection of the Region Lombardia. The most requested productions were: protective visors, valves and connectors for lung ventilators, tensioners for masks. Corriere.it spoke on the project,among others, on the news of 20th April as well as Tg Leonardo Rai 3 on 19th May.</p>
<h4 id="what-problems-have-we-encountered">What problems have we encountered?</h4>
<p>The main problem of the Air Factories platform was the impossibility of certifying the production processes and therefore the products produced, because of the numerous uncertainties related to the  real compliance of the printing parameters by the 3D makers involved. This has made it impossible to deploy medical or personal protective equipment in the post-lockdown stages, once the proven  emergency condition has ceased. The need to re-engineer the platform was therefore identified,  overcoming the difficulties encountered in the certification of products. This is to allow an effective response both in the emergency phase and in the overcoming of the emergency, thanks to the production devices that can be officially distributed. The new platform will also be useful in  case of future emergencies, of any nature, as it can prototype and produce new emergency devices  with fast response times.</p>
<h4 id="the-baseline-scenario">The baseline scenario</h4>
<p>The final aim of the Air Factories 2.0 project is the implementation of an intelligent, decentralized, sustainable and resilient production chain that allows the rapid prototyping of new projects and guarantees the certifiability of the parts produced. The actors involved are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Designer: they develop new projects to be produced in the distributed factory and use it for the prototyping of the first pieces;</li>
<li>Air Makers: they act both as validators of the projects in the prototyping phase of the product and as producers of finished pieces;</li>
<li>Air Caller: are those who require the production of a certain number of finished pieces by the distributed factory;</li>
<li>Air Admin: act as factory managers by semi-automatically mapping requests with the production capacity of the Air Makers.
The current version of the Air Factories platform connects Air Caller and Air Maker through the mediation of the Air Admin. It is centralized and carries out its task in a way that is not structurally transparent and verifiable from the outside. The Air Makers use classic 3D printers for which the production is not remotely verifiable. Finally, the recommendation of the material to be used for printing has so far been applied on a purely trust basis.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-design-idea-of-air-factories-20">The design idea of Air Factories 2.0</h4>
<p>The main objective of the Air Factories 2.0 project is related to the design, implementation and testing of the following deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Factories 2.0: new software platform based on the use of blockchain technologies. A fundamental requirement is to limit the role of the Air Admin. Potentially this role should disappear to make the factory a totally decentralized and transparent infrastructure;</li>
<li>Air Kit: universal kit based on crypto-processor technologies, for the transformation of classic 3D printers into nodes of the blockchain network that will make up the distributed factory;</li>
<li>Air Printer: &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; 3D printer, modular and with built-in Air Kit, which allows anyone to build, starting from raw materials, an entity constituting the distributed factory, reducing costs and logistics times.
A further objective of the project is the application of methodologies for the remote identification of the materials used in production for the purpose of biological compatibility according to the different products.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>Given the intrinsic multidisciplinarity of the objectives, the project involves the collaboration of 4 university staff units related to disciplinary scientific fields in areas 03 and 09. The principal investigator (ING-INF/05) has important skills, attested by scientific production, on the use of blockchain, smart contract and crypto-processor technologies for the implementation of decentralized platforms. The other units involved will provide expertise in the implementation of physical infrastructure (3D printing machines) and quality control processes (ING-IND/14 and ING-IND/15) and in the analysis of materials for identification activities (CHIM/07).
A group of research fellows joined the project with enthusiasm and are already working on the implementation of the platform.</p>
